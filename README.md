# InstagramBot

This is based on instagrambot/instabot and is basically a nice wrapper to do essential functions. Also bundled into an .exe with pyinstaller.

It's very simple. Look at the code to get an idea of what I've done.

Otherwise, head over to https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot for the simplest documentation on it available if you wanted to improve.
